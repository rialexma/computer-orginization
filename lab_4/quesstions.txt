1. the hello array does not allocate enough space and does not have a null charater at the end of the hello array.
2. to fix the bug we need to allocate more space for the array.
3. we type "gdb executable filename". in C they require a sort of encapsulation since we do not wnat any pointers roaming around freely.
4. con: using smart objects we can encapsulate the properties of a string unlike in dumb arrays where we cant store strings the same way.
   pro: int he arrays we always set the size manulally in C and not waste anymore space.
