1. To start debugging a program the command is "gdb Program.c".
2. it provides additional input for the executable.
3. you set a breakpoint by writing "break file:function".
4. it would have the command "break ... if expressions"2.
5. we use the command s to go after a breakpoint.
6. we use the command "next" to read the program line by line
7. use the command "continue".
8. use the command "print [/f] expression" to see the value of a variable.
9. use the command "display [/f] expression".
10. using the command info display to print all variables and values. 
11. using the command quit to exit gdb.
12. in line 14 the array was missing a null cahracter at the end of s1 array index.
13. line 15 caused the segmentation fault due to not being saved in the specific address
14. add the & symbol next to values in line 15.
15. the variables were not being referenced so I added the & symbol to sum and * in the read_values function parameters since it needs to be pointed in that specific address.
